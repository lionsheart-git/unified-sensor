# unified-sensor
This library is a spin-off of Adafruits wonderful [Adafruit_Sensor](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor).
I added some more sensor types and a modules level for "Sensors" that have more than one measuring sensor.

# Discalimer:
This library is in an early Alpha. The practical usability still has to be proven.
